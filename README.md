## spymux

**spymux** is a terminal user-interface for simultaneously watching all of your
open [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) panes.

Why? I pair program a fair amount with tools like [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex),
and I run them in different projects at the same time. I'd like a tool that gives
me a clear view into what the agents are doing, at the same time.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/terror/spymux
cd spymux
cargo install --path .
```
